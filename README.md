Service-Server-Integration library written in PHP for use with the Etalon Token-Integration-API.

The API is made to be as simple as possible, so integration from any environment would be cheap and easy. This repository demonstrates the integration procedure for the "simple" workflow.

## Usage

Aside from the `Etalon.php` file, all the others serve as Demo SDK. Serving the project from an IDE should work as-is.

## Disclaimer

This library is a work-in-progress.
